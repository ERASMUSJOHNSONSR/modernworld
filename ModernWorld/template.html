    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The static training plan is restructured into a dynamic single-page application. The core idea is to transform passive reading into active engagement. A tab-based navigation is used for the modules, allowing users to focus on one area at a time without overwhelming scrolling. This is more intuitive than a long document. Key interactions include a checklist for lessons which updates a master progress bar, providing instant feedback and a sense of accomplishment. A doughnut chart visualizes the lesson distribution, offering a quick data-driven overview of the course structure. This design was chosen to make the plan feel like a personalized tool rather than a static document, enhancing user motivation and clarity for beginners. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        Report Info: 6 Modules with multiple lessons each.
        Goal: Organize/Navigate.
        Viz/Presentation: Tabbed interface for modules. HTML/Tailwind styled cards for lessons.
        Interaction: User clicks a tab to show the relevant lessons.
        Justification: Breaks down the plan into manageable chunks, preventing information overload. Intuitive and common UI pattern.
        Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind + Vanilla JS.

        Report Info: List of lessons within each module.
        Goal: Engage/Track Progress.
        Viz/Presentation: Checkboxes next to each lesson item, a master progress bar.
        Interaction: Clicking a checkbox marks a lesson as "complete" and updates the progress bar's width and percentage text.
        Justification: Gamifies the learning plan, provides tangible feedback, and increases user motivation.
        Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind + Vanilla JS.

        Report Info: The overall structure of the course (number of lessons per module).
        Goal: Inform/Compare.
        Viz/Presentation: Doughnut Chart.
        Interaction: Hovering over a segment shows the module name and lesson count.
        Justification: Provides a quick, visual summary of the course content distribution, which is not immediately obvious from the text-only report. Adds a data visualization element.
        Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).
        
        Report Info: Assessment methods and Resources.
        Goal: Inform.
        Viz/Presentation: A two-column grid layout with icons.
        Interaction: None needed, this is static informational content.
        Justification: Clearly separates supplementary information from the core curriculum, improving scannability.
        Library/Method: HTML/Tailwind. -->
